## 🎯 About Me

I’m a data analyst who enjoys turning messy, real-world data into clean, decision-ready insights. I work in fast-paced production environments building dashboards and reporting systems that executives actually rely on — not “set it and forget it” visuals.

My background spans analytics, business intelligence, and applied research, with experience across enterprise systems, financial reporting, and operational analytics. I’ve worked in consulting-style environments, built end-to-end data pipelines, and partnered with both technical and non-technical stakeholders to drive measurable impact.

I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science & Epidemiology, which means I’m comfortable working at the intersection of analytics, statistics, and business logic.

**What I enjoy working on:**
- Writing efficient SQL that scales in production
- Designing dashboards that answer real business questions
- Identifying trends, anomalies, and performance drivers
- Translating numbers into insights leadership can act on
